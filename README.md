# CrossCode World Randomizer  

This mod randomizes all locations in CrossCode.  

## Features

## Installation

## âš  Disclaimer âš 

This software has been packaged using **PyInstaller**, which may cause some antivirus programs to flag it as a potential threat.  

###  Why is this happening?
- Certain antivirus programs may mistakenly flag **PyInstaller** executables as threats.
- The application **does not contain any malicious code**.
- You can verify this by checking a **ViruScanner** or reviewing the **source code**.

### How to proceed safely:
1. If Windows Defender blocks the file, click **"More info" > "Run anyway"**.
2. You can **add the file to your antivirus exceptions** if needed.
3. If you have concerns, you can run the **source code version** instead of the executable. (Python needed with matplotlib and neworkx)
4. Or simply wait until the version is known by Microsoft (Too long or need money for a certificate)

## Notes  
- The tutorial is not randomized because of all ablilities has not been unlock yet so it start at rookie harbor
- If you want the spoiler file, you can find it in `World_Rando_mods_{seed}/spoiler/spoiler.txt`.  
- Back up your original game files before using the randomizer.  
- If you encounter issues, restore your original maps from your backup.

## Known Issues  
- Only level 1 height is randomized because some maps (e.g., `guilde.entrance` has, like, *8* teleporters, 5 of which are inaccessible) contain multiple `TeleporterGround`, leading to unreachable areas.  
- Some `TeleporterGround` are used for developer debugging, which can teleport players into the void or the ground (e.g., in `autumn.path6` in the wall).  
- There may be errors when linking maps; they will be listed in `World_Rando_mods_{seed}/spoiler/unstable_link.txt`.  
- Randomizing enemies works fine, but randomizing bosses or unique enemies can cause softlocks due to enemy dependencies or invulnerable enemies.
